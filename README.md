# Hide the Most Visited pages in Chrome's New Tab page #

This extension removes the Most Visited website links from the default New Tab page in Chrome.

This extension works in Chrome 36, it checks to see if a new tab loaded is the New Tab page, and if it is, it hides the Most Visited section.

Note that the Most Visited section is still on the page, it is just not displaying.

Code is simple, and can be found at: https://github.com/claudiosmweb/chrome-hide-most-visited/
